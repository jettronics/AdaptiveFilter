# Adaptive Filter
At its core, an adaptive filter is a digital filter that adjusts its parameters based on the input it receives. Unlike traditional fixed filters with static coefficients, adaptive filters dynamically alter their settings to optimize performance in changing environments. This adaptability is what sets them apart, allowing them to excel in scenarios where the characteristics of the input signal may vary over time.
The magic of adaptive filters lies in their ability to learn and adapt. The two primary components driving this capability are the filter coefficients and the adaptation algorithm. The filter coefficients represent the adjustable parameters that the filter tunes to optimize its response, while the adaptation algorithm governs the adjustment process.
The working principle involves a continuous feedback loop: the adaptive filter processes the input signal, compares the output with the desired signal, computes the error, and adjusts its coefficients accordingly. This iterative process continues until the filter converges to an optimal configuration.
